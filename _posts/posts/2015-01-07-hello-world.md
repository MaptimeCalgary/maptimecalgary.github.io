We're putting together a Calgary chapter of the international [Maptime](http://maptime.io) community!  You're invited.  Head on over to the [about page](/about) to get a general sense of what we're hoping to form.

Things we currently need are:

- **Members**! This is the most crucial. They can be beginners or experts.
- **Presenters**! Also, very crucial. Have something you want to show off? Want to host a tutorial for other mappers?
- **Co-organizers**. Right now, the MaptimeCalgary team is super tiny. Help us grow the meetup and plan events!
- **A space**. This can be anything, but the following will be helpful:
  - Access to wifi
  - A projector
  - Enough tables and chairs to seat about 20 people
- **A sponsor**. Anybody that could help with operational costs or snack funds.

### Interested? Want to help?

Drop us a line on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/{{ site.owner.twitter }}) or send us an email at `maptimecalgary@gmail.com`. We'd love to hear who you are and what you're hoping to get out of MaptimeCalgary.
