This meetup is going to be split between two topics:

**Meta MaptimeCalgary**: A general discussion about what people are hoping to get out of MaptimeCalgary. We'll go through ways in which people can get involved with the group, figure out what kind of topics people are interested in learning about, and what kind of resources MaptimeCalgary can offer to help people with their projects.

**Introduction to WebMapping**: A general lay-of-the-land regarding the current (and past) state of putting maps online.

To help us get an idea of who's interested, please RSVP and then either send us an email at calgary@maptime.io or shoot a tweet to [@{{ site.owner.twitter }}](http://twitter.com/{{ site.owner.twitter }}) letting us know who you are and what you're hoping to get out of MaptimeCalgary.
