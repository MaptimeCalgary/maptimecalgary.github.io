**Topic 1: Getting Your First Webmap Online with Github**

Building off of [our last meetup](/meetups/2015/02/23/first-meetup/) (where we covered [Presentation Topic #5](https://github.com/MaptimeCalgary/maptimecalgary.github.io/issues/5)), we will continue with a tutorial where everyone creates their own basic webmap and then talk about how to use something like Github Pages (which is what we use to host the website and slides) to put it online. This will be more of a working-tutorial where everyone makes their own maps and uploads them to their own Github accounts, so that everyone will have their own project to experiment with.

Please come prepared with the following:

* A [Github account](https://github.com/join)
* A laptop (Windows, Mac, or Linux), set up with:
  * An installed text-editor (I recommend [atom.io](http://atom.io). Other options include SublimeText3, TextMate, TextWrangler, and Dreamweaver. Just about anything else that isn't MicrosoftWord is a valid choice.)
  * Have git installed (the simplest way to do this is by installing GUI client. Github offers one for [windows](https://windows.github.com/) and [mac](https://mac.github.com/). [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) from Bitbucket is also a good option.)
  * optional: Some data in KML or GeoJSON that you'd like to put on a map. If you want to prepare some data ahead of time (maybe a list of your favorite coffee shops or all the cities you've been to), try creating and saving the data with [geojson.io](http://geojson.io/)
